####Abstract
The town of Gold Hill, Colorado exists in an environment prone to wildfires and wildfire-related
destruc􀆟on. Understanding how wildfire ignites, spreads, and travels across the landscape is essen􀆟al to
protec􀆟ng the structures and values at risk in this type of “Wildland Urban Interface” environment. This
project conducts a predic􀆟ve analysis of possible wildfire behavior and risk to structures in Gold Hill. To
accomplish this analysis, data was used that related to predic􀆟ve wildfire behavior criteria such as fuels,
weather, and topography. The data was manipulated using geoprocessing tools and analyzed based on
the author’s own experience and study as a wildland firefighter to iden􀆟fy areas of high “risk” and
poten􀆟al extreme fire behavior. “Risk” in this case is a metric which will be explained below. The Results
show that Gold Hill is par􀆟cularly at “risk” from lightning and human-ignited fires which begin in light
fuels such as grass or shrubs, on steep slopes, on South aspects, or during strong wind events. Areas
where these factors operate together represent par􀆟cularly high “risk” areas where fire is more likely to
start, more likely to spread once it starts, and more likely to subsequently grow in size and intensity. The
areas of highest risk iden􀆟fied by this study include the saddle at the East end of town, the ridge also to
the East, the dispersed camping to the West, and the steep slopes to the North and South of the plateau
or ridge on which the town sits.
####Introduc􀆟on
Wildfires pose a significant risk to structures in Colorado’s front range, especially in a zone called the
Wildland Urban Interface (WUI), where dispersed homes and se􀆩lements have pushed further and
deeper into territories that were previously considered to be wilderness. Fire is a natural process of the
landscape and ecosystem in these areas, however humans s􀆟ll chose to build in these loca􀆟ons which
can put their communi􀆟es at risk. The town of Gold Hill is an example of such a loca􀆟on, where locals
have se􀆩led into what was once an old mining town and is now a hub of musical entertainment, outdoor
recrea􀆟on, and retreat. Gold Hill was nearly burned to the ground in the Fourmile fire of 2010, and
mul􀆟ple other historic fires have taken place nearby, some􀆟mes with devasta􀆟ng effects to the local
communi􀆟es. Gold Hill is considered by many to be an idyllic and historic mountain paradise, however
the local environment’s tendency towards devasta􀆟ng wildfires puts its structures and its community in
a posi􀆟on of considerable risk.
In order to mi􀆟gate this risk, it is essen􀆟al to understand the ways in which fire behaves, and par􀆟cularly
how it travels across the landscape. This study assesses the three major factors that influence wildland
fire behavior: fuels, weather, and topography. It does this by comparing datasets which model elements
of these three factors such as slope and eleva􀆟on (topography), and fuel model type (fuels). This paper
will discuss major geographic areas near Gold Hill where fires could be ignited, and areas where fire is
likely to spread or travel across the landscape.
####Methods
Analysis began with an extensive review of data sources, intended to locate informa􀆟on regarding fuels,
weather, and topography. Sources that were iden􀆟fied as having relevance to this project included
Digital Eleva􀆟on Models, maps of fire protec􀆟on districts, Boulder County’s Community Wildfire
Preparedness Plans (CWPP), a wildfire risk viewer produced by an analyst from Le􀅌hand FPD, sources
regarding historic wildfires, and in par􀆟cular datasets from the Landfire website
h􀆩ps://www.landfire.gov/, which contained useful raster datasets. These raster datasets provided the
founda􀆟on for much of the analysis.
A􀅌er downloading, vector and raster layers were added to a new map frame in ArcGIS pro. All vectors
and rasters were projected to the NAD 1983 UTM Zone 13 N using the project tool and the project raster
tool, respec􀆟vely. Data layers were symbolized using appropriate color schemes so that relevant pa􀆩erns
could be observed. Several data layers were found not to be useful, including a DEM from Boulder
County that consisted of numerous .img files. An a􀆩empt was made to use the mosaic tool to combine
these into a single raster, however this proved ineffec􀆟ve. The possibility of georeferencing a USGS
topographic map of Gold Hill was also briefly considered, however deemed to be impossible due to 􀆟me
constraints.
Next, a new map frame was opened and the most useful .􀆟f rasters were added. The Clip tool was run on
these to limit them to an approximately 78 square kilometer box centered on Gold Hill. In order to
manipulate the data as vector data, the Raster to Polygon tool was run on each .􀆟f file. To each of these
new polygon files, two new text fields were added, “􀄩hav” and “risk”. The author used personal
experience and study as a firefighter to fill out these fields, also referencing Anderson’s 13 fire behavior
models (h􀆩ps://www.fs.usda.gov/rm/pubs_int/int_gtr122.pdf). Informa􀆟on was included that detailed
expected behavior based on fuel model, slope, and vegeta􀆟on cover. “Risk” was determined by category
based on the likelihood of a fire to ignite or spread rapidly in a par􀆟cular fuel model, accelerate up a
steep slope, or based on the possibility of crown fires or spo􀆫ng.
Next, new feature classes were created based on areas that were considered to be “high risk”. These
were fire models in the grass and shrub types, since these represent the finest fuels and the highest
probability of igini􀆟on, and steep slopes, since these can drama􀆟cally increase the rate of a fire’s spread.
The fuel model layer was then clipped to the slope layer using the clip tool, and the feature was exported
to show areas where a steep slope and a “high risk” fuel model overlap. These are the areas with above
average risk, where fires could be ignited and spread quickly.
####Results and Discussion
The raster layers downloaded and displayed in the map frame provide useful reference informa􀆟on for
observing the characteris􀆟cs of the landscape and making predic􀆟ons of expected fire behavior and risk.
For example, the Digital Eleva􀆟on Model can be used to see the saddle at the East end of Gold Hill’s
downtown area, which would tend to funnel flames in the event of a fire. The ridge to the East of the
town is also visible, and is a feature which could a􀆩ract lightning. Other important features are the
steep-walled valleys to the North and South, which could catch fire in the event of an alignment with a
strong west wind (such as the “chinook” winds which blow over the Rocky Mountains from the West).
The fuel model map is highly informa􀆟ve, since fire would move differently in light fuels such as grass
and shrub (most prevalent on the south aspect of the valley to the town’s south) versus 􀆟mber and
heavy fuels, which are more prevalent to the North of the town.
####Conclusions
It is impossible to predict with certainty where any fire will ignite, or how it will travel. However, the
results of this analysis place the greatest risk to the town on a fire that begins to the West during a wind
event, perhaps ignited by dispersed camping in that area. Such a fire could rapidly spread through the
grass and shrub fuel models to the South of the town (on the South aspect of the slope that drops down
towards Fourmile Canyon). Lightning strikes on the ridge also pose a possible threat, as do uphillclimbing
fires ignited in Le􀅌hand Canyon to the North of the town. Such a fire could be devasta􀆟ng to
the historic buildings in the downtown area, as they are situated in a natural saddle which would tend to
funnel the heat and energy of a fire. Raster-based imagery from the Landfire website provides a good allaround
resource for response planning and mi􀆟ga􀆟on efforts, should these be desired in the future.
####Lessons Learned
The project provided ample opportuni􀆟es for beginning to learn techniques for manipula􀆟ng rasters. The
raster to polygon tool was par􀆟cularly useful. This was also an excellent opportunity to dive into fire
data, and see what types of sources exist as well as which ones are most useful. Given the opportunity to
con􀆟nue this research in the future, there are many direc􀆟ons it could be taken. For one thing, the
methodology could be applied to other geographical areas. Given more 􀆟me, I would like to locate and
track down sources of lightning and wind data, and spend more 􀆟me comparing and working with the
various datasets.
