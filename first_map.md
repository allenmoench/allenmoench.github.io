#### Python practice: Map of WWU

<embed type="text/html" src="img/wwu.html" width="600" height="600">

Above I've added a map of Western Washington University. This is my first attempt at coding an interactive map using Python. 
Western Washington University in Bellingham, WA was the university I attended for my undergraduate studies in Sustainability, 
Insterdisciplinary Studies, and Environmental Science. Located in the verdant green coastal town of Bellingham, this provided 
an ideal place to study the interactions between humans and the natural world. For more information, I'll link to their [website](https://www.wwu.edu/) 
and to a [wikipedia article on WWU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Washington_University).
