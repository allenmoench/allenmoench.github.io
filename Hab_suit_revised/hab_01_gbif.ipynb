    "## Study Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding grasslands is essential in understanding global carbon sinks. In particular, understanding the layer of soil that lies directly beneath the surface. The presence of Andropogon gerardii, or Big Bluestem, in grassland ecosystems has been significantly connected to the quantity of carbon stored in grassland ecosystems. Where there is more bluestem, there is more stored carbon. How has this changed in recent history - have there been any changes in Bluestem's range? How might Bluestem's range change in the future, given various climate scenarios? \n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, I will examine Bluestem's historical and future range across the Buffalo Gap and Little Missouri national grasslands. I will use several different variables to come up with a suitability raster, which will show areas in which the habitat is suitable for bluestem. I will look at elevation ranges as well as soil variables, and I will combine this with climate projection scenarios to determine ways in which the bluestem's habitat range might change.\n"

    "In terms of global carbon storage and sequestration, soil health is critical. Globally, soil organic carbon holds about 1550 Pg of carbon. Soil inorganic carbon holds about 950 Pg, which together make soil the third largest carbon pool on Earth after the geologic pool (4130 Pg, including fossil fuels) and the oceanic pool (38000 Pg)(Source 1). This figure represents around 80% of the carbon found in terrestrial ecosystems (Source 2).\n",

    "In terms of global carbon storage and sequestration, soil health is critical. Globally, soil organic carbon holds about 1550 Pg of carbon. Soil inorganic carbon holds about 950 Pg, which together make soil the third largest carbon pool on Earth after the geologic pool (4130 Pg, including fossil fuels) and the oceanic pool (38000 Pg)(Source 1). This figure represents around 80% of the carbon found in terrestrial ecosystems (Source 2).\n",
